# Schedule Assisant
This is a bot I built for fun the Summer after Facebook released
the Messenger API. The bot lives on a Facebook page and helps
people schedule appointments with the owner of the page.

To set up the bot, a user syncs a Google Calendar and a Facebook
page and sets some options the bot uses to great people it
interacts with.

Both the bot itself, which responds to Facebook messages, and
the webapp a user uses to set it up are included in this project.

I stopped working on this long ago so it is likely some things
don't work. I expect that by now there are nice libraries
abstracting away much of the details in this code.
